            <p>Hello!</p>
            <p>My name is Andrew Jonhardt, and I'm both an indie and Freelance game developer. My skills lie in:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h4>The Godot game engine</h4>
                    <p>I've been using Godot on and off since 2019 as a hobbyist. I failed to get very far just focusing on my own projects, and I've resolved to turn my focus towards the needs of others.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h4>Game Design</h4>
                    <p>I've been studying games and game design since 2018, when I first decided to try creating a game with the assistance of ATX Game Designers. I've learned what speaks to me most as a designer (area control + tactics and strategy), what a game is (check out <div class="book-title">Game Design Theory</div> by Keith Burgun), how to accept critism and feedback, and how to push a game from idea to completion.</p>
                </li>
